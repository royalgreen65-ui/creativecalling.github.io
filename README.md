## Preview locally

If you want to preview the minimal static site added to this repo, run a simple HTTP server from the repository root. In PowerShell:

```powershell
# serve current directory on port 8000
python -m http.server 8000 --directory "d:\\CreativeCalling\\creativecalling.github.io"
# then open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser
```

This repository now includes a simple scaffolded `index.html` and `assets/css/site.css` to get you started. Edit or add pages at the repository root and assets under `assets/`.

If you plan to switch to a generator (Jekyll, Hugo, Next.js), add the corresponding config files (`_config.yml`, `package.json`, etc.) and include build instructions here.
