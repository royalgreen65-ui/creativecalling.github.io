            <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, I'm Jamie</p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              I'm a devoted Christian with a passion for helping others find their way back to God's loving embrace. 
              Through Creative Calling, I share the lessons I've learned on my own spiritual journey, hoping to create 
              a quiet space where others can find rest and renewal in Christ.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              My mission is to combine modern technology with timeless spiritual truths, making it easier for people 
              to connect with God in our fast-paced world.

        <h2 class="display-5 mb-4 text-center">Our Story</h2>

        <div class="card mb-5">
          <div class="card-body">
            <p class="lead mb-4">
              Creative Calling began as a quiet whisper in the midst of modern noise. In a world that constantly demands our attention,
              productivity, and self-promotion, we felt called to create a space that points toward something deeper.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              This is not about building another platform or creating content for content's sake. This is about rediscovering
              the ancient path of stillness, humility, and rest in God's presence. We believe that in our hurried, achievement-oriented
              culture, the most revolutionary act is simply learning to be still and listen.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote mb-4">
              <p>"Be still, and know that I am God." ‚Äî Psalm 46:10</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Our prayer is that this space becomes a gentle invitation for you to come home. To lay down the burden of performance,
              the pressure to be "enough," and simply rest in the knowledge that you are deeply loved and fully known by the One
              who created you.

            <p class="mb-3">
              <strong>Minimalism:</strong> We believe less is often more. Our design is intentionally simple,
              creating space for reflection rather than distraction.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-3">
              <strong>Privacy:</strong> Your prayers and personal information stay private. We use secure,
              client-side processing whenever possible.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-3">
              <strong>Accessibility:</strong> We strive to make this space welcoming to everyone,
              regardless of technical ability or background.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-3">
              <strong>Grace:</strong> We extend the same grace to ourselves and others that God extends to us.
              There are no perfect people here, only those learning to receive love.
